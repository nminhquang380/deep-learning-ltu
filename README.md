# Deep Learning
Although most of recent Data Science problems can be solved by Basic Machine Learning algorithms such as Random Forest Tree, K Nearest Neighbor, SVM and so on. Learning about Deep Learning is still the future technology, which can solve more difficult problems, and finish human tasks.

Recently, even though I am following my Data Scienctist Plan, I found interested in Deep Learning. I tried sending some emails to my professor asking them for a role in their lab. Reasonably, every response mails I received were denial mails, which usually contains the word "Unfortunately".

It was sad but totally fine with me. Beucause, despite denial mail, my professor sent to me some helpful material. Is's about Deep Learning with some popular framework: TensorFlow and PyTorch.

For this reason, this repository is created with purpose of learning all those materials. Hopefully, I can complete this repo in the end of winter break. Let's try!
